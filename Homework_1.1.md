### 1a. Algorithm
1. In general way, an **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. Therefore, an algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output. To be brief, an algorithm is a **tool** to solve a well-specified **computational problem**. (From the textbook [Introduction To Algorithms-A3](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/ad22768345664924b202/files/?p=%2FBooks%20and%20Education%20Papers%2FTextbook%20PDFs%2FIntroduction_To_Algorithms-A3.pdf))
2. In bioinformatics, an algorithm is used to process and analyze biological data, such as aligning sequencese, predicting protein structure, or molecular simulation. For instance, an algorithm could be developed to simulate a protein and investigate its dynamics based on protein's force field.

### 1b. Model
1. The definition of **model** is broad. In mathematical logic, model is a structure consists of a set along with a collection of finitary operations and relations that are defined on it([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_(mathematical_logic))). 
2. But if we focus on bioinformatics area, a model typically refers to a **computational representation** of biological data, such as hidden markov model, deep learning, linear regression. These models were built based on algorithms.
### 1c. Conclusion
Algorithm is a method to process biological data, while a model is built using algorithm to represent or predict biological phenomena.
## 2. Study Plan for Bioinformatics
1. Read the related papers and chapters before the lecture
2. Practice the coding skills
3. Finish homework and try to do a project
